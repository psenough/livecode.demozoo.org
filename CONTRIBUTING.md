# How to contribute

Official repository is here : https://github.com/psenough/livecode.demozoo.org

## As an event participant 
If you have backup of your productions that are not listed (source file, shadertoy link, tic80.com cart, etc... ) you can either contact an admin of this repo with the data/file or create a Pull Request submitting the changes.

Just providing a missing source code should be sufficient to help us generate the preview image and your creation will be better archived on the repo.

## As an event organizer
We are aware that organizing an event takes time and you won't always keep full records of the live coding event, no worries, with a little bit of preparation, we can integrate your data in the repo.

To help the task be as smooth as possible here is what you should ideally have:

The minimum information needed is 
* The name, type and date of the event
* The entries performance with the person's handle

We would love to also have for archive completeness:
* The source code of the productions (if it's ok by the participant to spread it)
* The custom configuration of the software used (what exact version, custom textures, etc... )
* The results in case of a showdown / battle (bracket placings, points, etc... )

## Doing a Pull Request of data
If you are brave enough, you can sumbit a PR to the `main` branch. The pages of the website are auto generated by workflow scripts, we only need to update data is json compliant format.

* `/data` : Mandatory. The event information in json. You can look at other events for examples on how to use the proposed schema. It's defined [here](http://livecode.demozoo.org/doc/schema.html)

* `/media`: Optional. All preview image materials.
Note : If you included a shadertoy tic80 cart id, the image preview will be generated automatically by the workflow scripts.

* `/shader_file_sources` : Optional. Source code of your entries, organized by event.

We promise that one day we'll have a proper submission form to simplify the process :)

### Capturing a preview image

When there is no shadertoy link, this is what we use to capture the screenshots manually from a Bonzomatic GLSL source code file. You can use it aswell to help us capture missing screenshots. 

Capturing image from Bonzomatic:
```bash
ffmpeg -f gdigrab -i 'title=BONZOMATIC - GLFW' -vframes 1 -q:v 2 -y outfile.jpg 
```

Make sure image is 1280x720 (or any ratio of it).

Try to focus on jpg image (smaller) with some optimisation. We advise using `jpegoptim -m75 --strip-all file.jpg`

## As an frontend/backend developer
We are aware the website is ugly and full of small usability quirks that need to be improved, Pull Requests to improve these things are very welcome. Get involved in [the Issues tab](https://github.com/psenough/livecode.demozoo.org/issues) to discuss changes and new ideas.
